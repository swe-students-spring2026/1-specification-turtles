## Stakeholders

### Renters: 
During the interview, a candidate of the "renters" demographic of the app talked about his desire to make use of their unused furniture, earn extra side money, and decrease furniture waste. See the full list of his goals/frustrations below:

**Goals / Needs:**
- Make use of furniture that would otherwise sit unused while traveling or studying abroad
- Decrease waste of unused items
- Earn extra income by renting furniture to other students
- Make use of furniture items during break times such as winter or summer break

**Problems / Frustrations:**
- Furniture remains unused for months when they are away from school
- Limited income and financial pressure as college students
- No easy way to safely lend other students furniture in the short term 
- Limited space in apartment makes storing unused furniture inconvenient

### Lenders:
Interview Subject: A student who has their own production company and often rents out their gears to other people. See the full list of their goals/fristrations below:

**Goals / Needs:**
1. Easy to access on their phone to their rental page and messages, so they can see rental requests as soon as possible and talk to their renters more conveniently.
2. Insurance and agreements that protect their rights and the safety of their belongings
3. Space and opportunities to advertise their belongings so more people can see them and rent from them.
4. Need to be able to rate the people who rented from them in terms of whether they are on time for pickup and drop of and how well they take care of the equipment.

**Problems / Frustrations:**
1. On an existing film equipment rental website, rentees need to change the availability of every piece of equipment listed individually if they are out of town or don’t want to receive any rental requests. A status update on their profile saying they are out of town or pausing all rental requests would be helpful, so no user can rent from them when they are in that status.
2. Don’t know who they are renting to on online rental websites. Thus, very hard to trust people who rent from them to be responsible and will take care of their objects.
3. Renters are not responsive, causing difficulties for scheduling pick up and drop off times, and locking in the dates of rentals.
4. Not a clear or logical label system where the owner doesn’t know how to label their listings, so renters can find them easily.

### Admins:
Interview subject: A student who is experienced in buying and selling ACG goods and products on a second-hand platform. She addresses some needs and worries that an admin of such platform may have. 

**Goals / Needs:**
1. Maintain the platform's security and order, make sure there are no scams, counterfeit goods, or prohibited content.
2. Promptly address reports and disputes, provent users from feeling neglected.
3. Manage product categories and content quality. Prevent items like “sofas” from appearing in “electronics” listings.
4. Verify new and suspicious account. Monitor unusually active accounts and duplicate postings.

**Problems / Frustrations**
1. Too many reports but no prioritization system. The admin cannot keep up with every single one.
2. Hard to tell who's lying. Buyers claim they are scammed, and sellers say they are unreasonable.
3. Unclear platform rules leading to a lack of basis when handling disputes.
4. Too many manual labor when deleting and banning.


### Buyers:
An international student at NYU was interviewed about their experience purchasing secondhand furniture while living off campus. See the full list of their goals/fristrations below:

**Goals / Needs:**
- Find furniture at a significantly lower price than new items
- Make sure that items are up to quality and in good condition before buying
- Opportunities to discover furniture with unique aesthetic/style that cannot be found in typical stores
- Reduce waste by reusing furniture

**Problems / Frustrations**
- Difficulty finding specific styles/sizes/colors that match their needs
- Challenges in transporting bulky items, especially as a student without a car in NYC
- Lack of warranty if the furniture doesn't meet expectations or breaks quickly
- Worry about hidden damages that sellers would potentially cover up for a better price

## Stakeholders

### Renters: 
During the interview, a candidate of the "renters" demographic of the app talked about his desire to make use of their unused furniture, earn extra side money, and decrease furniture waste. See the full list of his goals/frustrations below:

**Goals / Needs:**
- Make use of furniture that would otherwise sit unused while traveling or studying abroa
- Decrease waste of unused items
- Earn extra income by renting furniture to other students
- Make use of furniture items during break times such as winter or summer break

**Problems / Frustrations:**
- Furniture remains unused for months when they are away from school
- Limited income and financial pressure as college students
- No easy way to safely lend other students furniture in the short term 
- Limited space in apartment makes storing unused furniture inconvenient



### Buyers:
An international student at NYU was interviewed about their experience purchasing secondhand furniture while living off campus. See the full list of their goals/fristrations below:

**Goals / Needs:**
- Find furniture at a significantly lower price than new items
- Make sure that items are up to quality and in good condition before buying
- Opportunities to discover furniture with unique aesthetic/style that cannot be found in typical stores
- Reduce waste by reusing furniture

**Problems / Frustrations**
- Difficulty finding specific styles/sizes/colors that match their needs
- Challenges in transporting bulky items, especially as a student without a car in NYC
- Lack of warranty if the furniture doesn't meet expectations or breaks quickly
- Worry about hidden damages that sellers would potentially cover up for a better price

- As a buyer, I want to read reviews from other buyers about a seller so that I feel confident that I’m buying from someone trustworthy.
- As a buyer, I want to compare prices with similar items as well as the price of a new item of the same model, so that I know I’m getting a good deal.
- As a buyer, I want to save or bookmark items I like so that I can come back to them later and compare options.
- As a buyer, I want the option to arrange delivery or pickup help so that I can get bulky furniture without needing a car.
- As a buyer, I want to message sellers easily before buying so that I can ask questions about condition, measurements, etc.

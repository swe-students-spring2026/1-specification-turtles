## Stakeholders

### Renters: 
During the interview, a candidate of the "renters" demographic of the app talked about his desire to make use of their unused furniture, earn extra side money, and decrease furniture waste. See the full list of his goals/frustrations below:

**Goals / Needs:**
- Make use of furniture that would otherwise sit unused while traveling or studying abroa
- Decrease waste of unused items
- Earn extra income by renting furniture to other students
- Make use of furniture items during break times such as winter or summer break

**Problems / Frustrations:**
- Furniture remains unused for months when they are away from school
- Limited income and financial pressure as college students
- No easy way to safely lend other students furniture in the short term 
- Limited space in apartment makes storing unused furniture inconvenient

### Rentees / Furniture Owners:
Interview Subject: A student who has their own production company and often rents out their gears to other people. See the full list of their goals/fristrations below:

**Goals / Needs:**
1. Easy to access on their phone to their rental page and messages, so they can see rental requests as soon as possible and talk to their renters more conveniently.
2. Insurance and agreements that protect their rights and the safety of their belongings
3. Space and opportunities to advertise their belongings so more people can see them and rent from them.
4. Need to be able to rate the people who rented from them in terms of whether they are on time for pickup and drop of and how well they take care of the equipment.

**Problems / Frustrations:**
1. On an existing film equipment rental website, rentees need to change the availability of every piece of equipment listed individually if they are out of town or don’t want to receive any rental requests. A status update on their profile saying they are out of town or pausing all rental requests would be helpful, so no user can rent from them when they are in that status.
2. Don’t know who they are renting to on online rental websites. Thus, very hard to trust people who rent from them to be responsible and will take care of their objects.
3. Renters are not responsive, causing difficulties for scheduling pick up and drop off times, and locking in the dates of rentals.
4. Not a clear or logical label system where the owner doesn’t know how to label their listings, so renters can find them easily.

## Product Vision Statement

A peer-to-peer marketplace where college students can buy, sell, rent, and borrow second-hand furniture from one another, creating a safe environment for affordable, eco-friendly furnishings.

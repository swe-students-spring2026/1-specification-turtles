## Stakeholders

### Rentees:
Interview Subject: A student who has their own production company and often rents out their gears to other people. See the full list of their goals/fristrations below:

**Goals / Needs:**
1. They want easy to access on their phone to their rental page and messages, so they can see rental requests as soon as possible and talk to their renters more conveniently.
2. They want insurance and agreements that protect their rights and the safety of their belongings
3. Space and opportunities to advertise their belongings so more people can see them and rent from them.
4. Need to be able to rate the people who rented from them in terms of whether they are on time for pickup and drop of and how well they take care of the equipment.

**Problems / Frustrations:**
1. On an existing film equipment rental website, rentees need to change the availability of every piece of equipment listed individually if they are out of town or don’t want to receive any rental requests. A status update on their profile saying they are out of town or pausing all rental requests would be helpful, so no user can rent from them when they are in that status.
2. Don’t know who they are renting to on online rental websites. Thus, very hard to trust people who rent from them to be responsible and will take care of their objects.
3. Renters are not responsive, causing difficulties for scheduling pick up and drop off times, and locking in the dates of rentals.
4. Not a clear or logical label system where the owner doesn’t know how to label their listings, so renters can find them easily.

During the interview, a candidate of the "renters" demographic of the app talked about his desire to make use of his unused furniture, earn extra side money, and decrease furniture waste. See the full list of his goals/frustrations below:

**Goals / Needs:**
1. Make use of furniture that would otherwise sit unused while traveling or studying abroad
2. Decrease waste of unused items
3. Earn extra income by renting furniture to other students
4. Make use of furniture items during break times such as winter or summer break

**Problems / Frustrations:**
1. Furniture remains unused for months when they are away from school
2. Limited income and financial pressure as college students
3. No easy way to safely lend other students furniture in the short term 
4. Limited space in apartment makes storing unused furniture inconvenient

### Renters: 
Interview Subject: An international student who is a senior in college and is currently looking for new furniture for their last year living around campus. See the full list of their goals and frustration below.

**Goals / Needs:**
1. They need furniture that they only need for a period of time.
2. They want to see ratings for the furniture owner so they have a standard to decide whether to rent from them or not.
3. They need to see the furniture owner's location so they can decide if they can pick it up or ship it to them.
4. They want to see detailed photos of the furniture they are renting in order to insure that it is good to use.

**Problems / Frustration**
1. Buying new furniture is too expensive for only using it for a year.
2. The current existing softwares are all open to everyone in the area, thus there are a lot of not trustworthy people to rent from.
3. Many furniture owners don't reply or reply very slowly, causing inconvinience to scheduling pickup and drop off.
4. Many existing platforms charge a large amount of extra fees for every transaction as a platform fee.

### Admins:
Interview subject: A student who is experienced in buying and selling ACG goods and products on a second-hand platform. She addresses some needs and worries that an admin of such platform may have. 

**Goals / Needs:**
1. Maintain the platform's security and order, make sure there are no scams, counterfeit goods, or prohibited content.
2. Promptly address reports and disputes, provent users from feeling neglected.
3. Manage product categories and content quality. Prevent items like “sofas” from appearing in “electronics” listings.
4. Verify new and suspicious account. Monitor unusually active accounts and duplicate postings.

**Problems / Frustrations**
1. Too many reports but no prioritization system. The admin cannot keep up with every single one.
2. Hard to tell who's lying. Buyers claim they are scammed, and sellers say they are unreasonable.
3. Unclear platform rules leading to a lack of basis when handling disputes.
4. Too many manual labor when deleting and banning.


### Buyers:
An international student at NYU was interviewed about their experience purchasing secondhand furniture while living off campus. See the full list of their goals/fristrations below:

**Goals / Needs:**
1. Find furniture at a significantly lower price than new items
2. Make sure that items are up to quality and in good condition before buying
3. Opportunities to discover furniture with unique aesthetic/style that cannot be found in typical stores
4. Reduce waste by reusing furniture

**Problems / Frustrations**
1. Difficulty finding specific styles/sizes/colors that match their needs
2. Challenges in transporting bulky items, especially as a student without a car in NYC
3. Lack of warranty if the furniture doesn't meet expectations or breaks quickly
4. Worry about hidden damages that sellers would potentially cover up for a better price

## Product Vision Statement

A peer-to-peer marketplace where college students can buy, sell, rent, and lent second-hand furniture from one another, creating a safe environment for affordable, eco-friendly furnishings.
